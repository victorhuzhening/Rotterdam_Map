## About the Map

This map is meant for bikers in Rotterdam. Although it is important to mention that Rotterdam is far more complex and interesting than any map could try to reflect, with this project being just one attempt at this. I chose to focus on a day and summer time map for the illustrations and concept, but with the correct gear (lights, jackets, rain gear) I hope that this information will bring people outdoors in the fall and winter as well. <33 please enjoy, and when printing, I advise a minimum of 60x70cm so the text is still legible.
